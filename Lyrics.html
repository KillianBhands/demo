        Wise men say
        Only fools rush in
        But I can't help falling in love with you
        Shall I stay?
        Would it be a sin
        If I can't help falling in love with you?
        Like a river flows
            Surely to the sea
            Darling, so it goes
            Some things are meant to be
            Take my hand
            Take my whole life, too
            For I can't help falling in love with you
            Like a river flows
            Surely to the sea
            Darling, so it goes
            Some things are meant to be
            Take my hand
            Take my whole life, too
            For I can't help falling in love with you
            For I can't help falling in love with you</pre>
